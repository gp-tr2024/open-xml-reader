# Open xml reader
his Maven project module, written in Java, can be used for reading an excel file in open xml format (high performance).
The library reads a sheet and parse it in a buffered way (i.e. you can control the read flow, in order to have a better memory management).

## Dependencies
All project dependencies are listed in the [pom.xml](pom.xml) file.

## Import the project
In order to import the project correctly into the integrated development environment (e.g. Eclipse), it is necessary to download the project together with all its dependencies.
The project and all its dependencies are based on the concept of "project object model" and hence Apache Maven is used for the specific purpose.

_Please note that the "SWT.jar" and the "Jface.jar" libraries (if used) must be downloaded and installed manually in the Maven local repository since are custom versions used in the tool ((install 3rd party jars)[https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-3rd-party-jars-local.html])._
